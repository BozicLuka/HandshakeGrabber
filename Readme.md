# HandshakeGrabber

This is a super simple handshake grabbing automation with aircrack suite made for beginners just getting into wireless hacking. It works on Debian based systems, but you might need to add the aircrack-ng repository if your system doesn't have it included.

** You can install aircrack-ng suite here: https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng or just run the setup.py **
